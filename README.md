If anyone is experiencing difficulties extracting and loading the dataset from the zip file, I've mentioned the direct links to the xlsx and CSV files (both are same datasets, download anyone that works) for your convenience. Simply click on the links to open the files in your web browser. From there, navigate to Files -> Save As -> Download a copy to save the file to your local environment.
